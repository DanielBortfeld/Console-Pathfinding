# A*   
This console application demonstrates the pathfinding algorithms BreadthFirst, BestFirst, Dijkstra and A\*. The picture below shows the result for a path searched with A\*. The green point represents the start of the path, the red point is the goal. The path itself is colored pink/purple. Grey numbers have been taken from the open list and have been investigated for a path. White numbers have not been investigated. The numbers represent both the nodes and the cost of traversing the node. Black points can not be traversed.
